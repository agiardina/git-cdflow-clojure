usage: git cdflow release list
       git cdflow release start [--no-push] <release> <parent>
       git cdflow release checkout <release>

       list       Show the list of release branches available on origin.                         
                  Local branches are ignored and branches with wrong syntax are                  
                  ignored. In order to be considered a valid release branch,                     
                  the branch has to match the following name convention:                         
                  release/v[major].[minor].[maintenance], eg. release/v9.1.0                     
                                                                                                 
        start     Start a new release.                                                           
                  The <release> parameter is mandatory but it's possible                         
                  to specify partial release name.

                  All the following release names are valid: v8.2.3, 8, 8.2, 8.2.3.              
                  In all the above scenarios the branch release/v8.2.3 will be                   
                  created.                                                                       
                                                                                                 
                  The <parent> parameter is mandatory but it's possible                         
                  to specify partial parent name. 
                                                                                                 
                  The <parent> branch must be present on origin and it has to follow 
                  right name convention (see "git cdflow release list"). The parent
                  can be a feature branch or a release branch. If partial name is provided
                  release is assumed. 

                  The --no-push option is intended for debugging purpose only                  
                                                                                                 
                  Example usage:
